The basic design is that:
Product contains information about the name, category, origin.

ProductPurchase contains information about a purchase of a particular product
including price, quantity and tax

Order consists of a list of ProductPurchases

Tax contains rate, name and tax policy (i.e. when to apply the tax and when not to)

ITaxPolicy is an interface that tells whether a product should be taxable.

BasicSalesTaxPolicy and ImportTaxPolicy implements ITaxPolicy.


To run, simply run as JUnit Test for PrintReceipt.java
Since the emphasis is not on UI, I put output in the console. 
This output will be printed when JUnit test runs.
